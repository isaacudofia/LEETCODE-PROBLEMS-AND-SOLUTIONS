# LeetCode Solutions Repository

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, tackling challenges **from simple questions to complex ones.**

My aim is to document my journey and provide clear solutions that can be helpful to others.

## Structure

Solutions are organized to make them easy to find. You can typically browse by:

* **Difficulty:** Problems are often grouped by Easy, Medium, and Hard.
* **Topic/Category:** Solutions might be further organized by the core concept or data structure involved (e.g., Arrays, Dynamic Programming, Trees, etc.).
* Each problem usually has its own folder containing the code solution(s) and potentially a brief explanation.

## Exploring Solutions

Navigate through the folders to find solutions based on the problem's difficulty or topic. Each solution file or its accompanying README (if available) will contain the code.

## Contributing

If you have a better solution, notice an error, or want to contribute in any way, feel free to open a pull request. Please try to follow the existing structure and add a brief explanation for your approach.
